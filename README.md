# First-Come-First-Serve-CPU-Scheduling-Simulation
A program that simulates the FCFS CPU scheduling algorithms. The program has two ways to get processesâ€™ related information: 
1) read in an input file where a sequence of process arrival &amp; burst times is stored;
2) user specifies process number (less than 20) and then random generate related arrival &amp; burst times.
